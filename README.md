# Rock-Paper-Scissors

## Description

This project is an implementation of the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS). Inspired by the research paper "Social cycling and conditional responses in the Rock-Paper-Scissors game" by Zhijian Wang, Bin Xu, and Hai-Jun Zhou, this project explores decision-making strategies and patterns observed in human behavior during the game.

## Features

- Interactive web-based RPS game.
- Keeps track of player and computer scores.
